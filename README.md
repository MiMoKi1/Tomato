# Tomato

Tomato is a CLI-based testing automation tool that supports BDD workflows, API testing, UI automation, and test documentation generation. It's built to streamline testing with Gherkin files, enabling seamless integration with Selenium for UI tests and Axios for API testing.

Features
Upload and Parse Gherkin Files: Automatically parse Gherkin .feature files to generate structured test steps.
Automated UI Testing with Selenium: Execute UI tests on Chrome, including login functionality and error handling.
API Testing: (Planned) Axios integration for sending requests and validating responses as part of your API tests.
Documentation Generation: Generate HTML documentation for test steps and logs.
GitHub Versioning: Tracks project versions, ensuring smooth collaboration and version control.

Working on its API testing and currently testing the CLI tool...more to come.
